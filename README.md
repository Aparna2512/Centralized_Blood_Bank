Centralized Blood Bank Management System

Problem Overview

Traditional blood donation awareness relies on media like radio, newspapers, or TV.
Current manual systems face issues in managing donor records, leading to data loss or duplication due to human error.
Lack of a centralized donor database complicates blood searches during emergencies.
Donorsâ€™ past donations are not tracked across different banks; new donations are treated as first-time donations without previous records.
Manual systems struggle to monitor blood stock levels, expiry, and minimum thresholds.
